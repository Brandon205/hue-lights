# Hue Lite

Hue Lite is a small web based app that uses React, Axios, and the Hue API to allow users to have basic control of their Hue products on the web! There are a lot of different apps and some sites that do similar things but this one might just be the simplest to setup and get working, with only the IP Address of the Hue bridge needed (which might even get autofilled for you). After setup there are 2 main tabs, one that lists all of the lights that are connected to that bridge, as well as a Groups tab that has controls for the groups tied to that bridge (For now these groups do need to be created in the Hue app). On/Off as well as color and brightness for lights that support those features are the controls that are available currently, but there are more features and controls planned and on the way!
